# 0. What is this?
This is summary of the basic concepts of college statistics.  The information was taken from [Khan Academy's Statistics Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhxtUt_-GyM&list=PL1328115D3D8A2566)

# 1. Descriptive Statistics vs Inferential Statistics
- __Descriptive:__ finding indicative numbers that describe a dataset without having to go through all the data set.
- __Inferential:__ finding conclusions about a population through studying a random sample of that population.

# 2. Measures of central tendency
There are many ways to represent a dataset's central tendency. Some of the most used indicators of central tendency are:

- __Arithmetic Mean:__ The well known mean.
- __Median:__ Sort all numbers in order and find the number that is in the middle. If the dataset is even, the median is the arithmetic mean of the two middle numbers.
- __Mode:__ The number that repeats the most. If there are 2 numbers that repeat equally, any could be chosen as the mode of the dataset.

# 3. Population vs Sample
This is better explained through an example.  Imagine you want to know the average height of women in the US.

- __Population:__ The 150 million women that live in the US. (You typically can't survey the whole population.)
    - Population size is noted with the letter `N` (e.g `N = 150 million women`) 
- __Sample:__ A __random__ subset of the women in the population (e.g 2000 randomly chosen women.)
    - Sample size is noted with the letter `n` (e.g `n = 2000 randomly chosen women`)

# 4. Population mean vs Sample mean
Population mean and sample mean are calculated in the same way. However there are some differences in the notation.
