# What is this?
This is summary of the basic concepts of college statistics.  The information was taken from [Khan Academy's Statistics Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhxtUt_-GyM&list=PL1328115D3D8A2566)

# 1. Descriptive Statistics vs Inferential Statistics
- __Descriptive:__ finding indicative numbers that describe a dataset without having to go through all the data set.
- __Inferential:__ finding conclusions about a population through studying a random sample of that population.

# 2. Measures of central tendency
There are many ways to represent a dataset's central tendency. Some of the most used indicators of central tendency are:

- __Arithmetic Mean:__ The well known mean.
- __Median:__ Sort all numbers in order and find the number that is in the middle. If the dataset is even, the median is the arithmetic mean of the two middle numbers.
- __Mode:__ The number that repeats the most. If there are 2 numbers that repeat equally, any could be chosen as the mode of the dataset.
